we have a lot of rides in New York for tomorrow, and we have a lot drivers in New York. We need to do a backend algorithm to figure out which ride to give to which driver so that

1. there is no conflict, e.g., we don't want to give the 2 different rides at 9 AM to the same driver

2. we want to give the ride a lower priced driver if possible.

3. if we give a ride to pick up a passenger from New York time square and drop off the passenger at JFK airport to a driver, the next ride we give to the same driver should preferably pick up from JFK airport, this way, the driver doesn&#39;t have to
drive a lot without a paying passenger on the car.

You may assume as input a collection of rides. Each ride consists of pickup
time, pickup location
(latitude/longitude), pickup address, drop off location/address and estimated
ride duration.
Please let us know how you would do the Algorithm &amp; Python Code, save your
algorithm and
python code in .txt format and e-mail meÂ your response/solution to
hitesha@elifetransfer.com
Please add your updated resume in same email.
